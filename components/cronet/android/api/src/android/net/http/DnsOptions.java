/**
 * A class configuring the host resolution functionality. Note that while we refer to {@code
 * DNS} as the most common mechanism being used for brevity, settings apply to other means of
 * resolving hostnames like hosts file resolution.
 *
 * <p>Hostnames can be resolved in two ways - either by using the system resolver (using {@code
 * getaddrinfo} provided by system libraries), or by using a custom resolver which is tailored
 * for the HTTP networking stack.
 *
 * <p>The built-in stack provides several advantages over using the global system resolver:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>It has been tailored to the needs of the HTTP networking stack, particularly speed and
 *       stability.
 *   <li>{@code getaddrinfo} is a blocking call which requires dedicating worker threads and makes
 *       cancellation impossible (we need to abandon the thread until the call completes)
 *   <li>The {@code getaddrinfo} interface gives no insight into the root cause of failures
 *   <li>{@code struct addrinfo} provides no TTL (Time To Live) of the returned addresses. This
 *       restricts flexibility of handling caching (e.g. allowing the use of stale DNS records) and
 *       requires us to either rely on OS DNS caches, or be extremely conservative with the TTL.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Most configuration in this class is only applicable if the built-in DNS resolver is used.
